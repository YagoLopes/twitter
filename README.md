## Some Observations about this App

- There's no functionality of Login/Register.

### Installing

- I chose to use docker-compose in order to minimize application execution failures, if you choose not to use it, you will have to have a url from a mongo bank, and set it in **\*backend/src/index.js[mongoose.connect (" URL ")]**

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YagoLopes/twitter

$ cd jshunt
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ cd frontend
```

```
$ yarn
```

_and_

```
$ cd ../backend
```

```
$ npm install
```

### Running

With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app:

Run
